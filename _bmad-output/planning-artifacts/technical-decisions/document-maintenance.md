# Document Maintenance

**Update Frequency:** ADRs are updated as decisions are made during architecture and implementation phases.

**Ownership:** Architect owns this document; Lead Engineer maintains technical accuracy.

**Review Cycle:** Quarterly review to ensure ADRs reflect current state and supersede outdated decisions.

**Version Control:** All changes tracked in Git; significant decisions trigger document version bump.

**Next Steps:**

1. Architecture workflow to finalize ADR-001 through ADR-005
2. Create `/docs/adr/` folder for individual ADR files (optional for detailed decisions)
3. Link ADRs to epics/stories in [epics.md](./epics.md) for traceability
